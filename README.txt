-------------------SAVE JOB VACANCY IN DATABASE----------------

A Basic Example of Using Fast API with PostgreSQL database using Python (3.9)


Database File i.e., jobs.sql: 

Database script is in jobs.sql file to be run in PostgreSQL. You must install PostgreSQL database. Replace your username, port and password, and host if its not running on your remote maching in __connect__ of database_access.py.


Pre-requisits:

Please install all dependencies either using requirements.txt or one by one from manual_installation.txt. Pardon me if I missed anyone to add in manual_installation.txt


Platform Tested:

This sourcecode is working perfectly on windows os. 

Services :

Basic functionality of add, edit, delete, list a job in database along with a login API. Kindly run the user.py independently and add a user in database.
One added. A valid access (Authorization Bearer) token is required for all 4 of job APIs. Token is generated by login api.

Once all installations are done. Run the command "uvicorn main:app --reload" in terminal, copy the IP it is live on and paste it in browser appended with /docs. e.g http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs. If all is well you'll see a swagger documented list of all service end points. Test your APIs.
